# dots

this is a (wip) collection of my dotfiles

# apps

 - ghostty
 - neovim
 - tmux
 - zsh

# before installation

install [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for easy symlinking.

# installation

```zsh
# go into dotfiles directory
cd ~/.dotfiles

# symlink each app
stow <APPNAME>

# example
stow ghostty
```
